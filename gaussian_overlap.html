<h1>Confidence Interval Overlaps</h1>
<p>We are interested in overlap of two Confidence Intervals.
One of the CI's is from training, another estimated from live data.

We assume that the CI's are distributed normally, and get the following -

$$X_1 \sim Normal(\mu_1, \sigma_1^2)\\
X_2 \sim Normal(\mu_2, \sigma_2^2)$$</p>

<h2>Uniform Overlap</h2>
A possible measure for CI overlap is $\frac{|Overlap|}{|CI1| |CI2|}$. Note that this is equivalent to $\int f'(x) g'(x) dx$, where $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$ are uniform distributions associated wiht the CI's.</p>

<h2>Gaussian Overlap</h2>
As a generalization of above, especially if we know the distributions are closer to Normal, a candidate is Gaussian Overlap defined as -

$$\begin{array}{l}
\int f(x) g(x) dx&= E_F\ g(X_1) = E_G\ f(X_2)\\
&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sqrt{\sigma_1^2+\sigma_2^2}} exp\left(\frac{(\mu_1-\mu_2)^2}{2(\sigma_1^2+\sigma_2^2)}\right)
\end{array}$$

<h1>Interactive Simulation</h1>
<p>
Instructions: Pretend one of the CI's is for prediction, the other from observed data. Hold the observation CI constant, and check the effect of prediction CI's on the score.
